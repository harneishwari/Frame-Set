<hr><u>Sun Temple</u>
<p><i>'Konark Sun Temple' is a 13th century Sun Temple at Konark, in Orissa. It is also known as the 'Black Pagoda'. The name Konark is derived from the Sanskrit word Kona (meaning corner) and word Arka (means sun) in reference to the temple which was dedicated to the Sun god Surya. The temple is one of the most renowned temples in India and is a World Heritage Site.</i></p>

<p><i>Konark Sun Temple is also a paragon of Oriyan art and architecture. The temple was built by the Ganga dynasty ruler, Narsimha Dev I in 13th century. It took 12 years to complete this temple. Although parley in runes, its colossal size, intricate stone art work and diversity of themes expressed, simply take one's breath away.</i>
