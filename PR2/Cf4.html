<hr><u><b>QUTUB MINAR</b></u>

    <p><i><b>One of the fascinating tourist spots in Delhi is Qutub Minar. With a height of 72.5 m, this is the tallest minaret constructed using bricks in the world. It is considered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This minaret is considered to be the epitome of victory. Qutub-Ud-In Aibak, a deputy employed by Muhammad of Ghor, started establishing this minaret in Delhi as a memoir of victory. It is considered as the sign of the Delhi Sultanate.</b></i></p>

<p><b><i>The architecture of Qutub Minar was inspired by the construction of Minaret of Jam. It is 62 meters tall and was constructed in the year 1190. The architect of Qutub Minar is Varahamihira, a Hindu by birth. This is why the architectural aspect of this minaret has both Indo-Islamic and Afghan styles conglomerated to form a unique design. The tower slowly tapers at the top and has 379 spiraling steps. It has five stories built in different timelines and represents different historical events. The base diameter is 14.32 meters whereas the top diameter is 2.75 meters. There are beautiful balconies projecting from each storey making it a unique minaret. Due to its immense historical significance, it is counted as one of the World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in India. Indiaâ€™s first mosque named Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid was constructed on the northeastern side of this minaret in 1198.</i></b></p>
